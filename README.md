## Frac Dash

A Python Dash dashboard that is refreshed daily for frac reports within Alberta. Can see frac reports from confidential wells that are typically only published after a year.
This is an attempt at speeding up data that is disclosed in PDF reports on [FracFocus](http://fracfocus.ca/en).
