## Frac Dash

A Python Dash dashboard that is refreshed daily for frac reports within Alberta. Can see frac reports from confidential wells that are typically only published after a year in more conventional data streams. Here they will appear within ~ 30 days of frac end date.

This is an attempt at speeding up data analysis on frac reports that are disclosed in PDF reports on [FracFocus](http://fracfocus.ca/en).
